Python-based Text Tokenizer

This python script was made to clean dirty text files: remove markup tags, unnecessary numbers, special-characters those such as "123456:;7890(){}[]!$%*&=:?,.+-\\\/\"\"'"

It also includes a filwriter to output the cleaned text with the word frequency beside it.

Drop me a message or if you need help in running it or have any questions.

Cheers!
